# PixelRuler
PixelRuler is a simple ruler for your computer. It takes 2 points on the screen and sets the distance between the chosen 
2 points as the reference distance. Then, it can find the relative distance between any other 2 points on the screen.

SETUP: Have the [lastest JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
installed on your computer. Then, run the PixelRuler.jar file in /out/artifacts by typing in javaw.exe -jar PixelRuler.jar from a command line open in the folder with PixelRuler.jar in it.

HOW TO USE:
  * Press on your F12 key and click on any 2 points on the screen. These 2 points will be your reference points.
  * Input a number of what you would like the distance between these 2 points would be.
  * The distance of the last 2 points that are clicked on the screen
before pressing "Find Length" are returned, with the distance being in relation to the chosen reference points and the inputted number

EXAMPLE USE:
Trying to eyeball the exact linear distance between Calgary and Montreal would be difficult. With PixelRuler, you can simply
press F12, click on "0km" and then "1000km" on the scale at the bottom of the map, input 1000 into the text field, 
click on Calgary and Montreal, then press 
"Find Length". This will give you an exact distance of 2982.85km
